# Basic Python Calculator 
This code implements a simple calculator in Python. It takes two numbers and an operation as inputs and then performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on the numbers. The supported operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^).

# Inputs
The user needs to input the following three values in order:

1. num1 : The first number to be used in the calculation. This should be an integer.

2. num2 : The second number to be used in the calculation. This should also be an integer.

3. operation : The arithmetic operation to be performed on the two numbers. This should be one of the following five values: "+", "-", "*", "/", or "^".

# Output
The output will depend on the values of the inputs. If the operation is addition, the sum of the two numbers will be printed. If the operation is subtraction, the difference between the two numbers will be printed. If the operation is multiplication, the product of the two numbers will be printed. If the operation is division, the quotient of the two numbers will be printed. If the operation is exponentiation, the first number raised to the power of the second number will be printed.
# Example

Here is an example of how to use the calculator:

```bash
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Enter operation: *

Output:
15

```
This means that the product of 5 and 3, which is 15, is printed.
